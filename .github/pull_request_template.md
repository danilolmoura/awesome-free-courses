If you want to add a course to this list, please make sure that:

- [ ] The course is organized in a playlist whose videos has a logical order
- [ ] The course can't be with just one video
- [ ] Place them in alphabetical order
- [ ] Add courses to one category at a time - _avoid conflicts and simplify review_
- [ ] It's necessary to add a new category to `Table of contents` if the suggestion is creating a new one
- [ ] Check if your suggestion follows the pattern `| [<course name>](<course link>) | <language> | [<channel name>](<channel link>) |`

If they meet the requirements above, feel free to create a PR! 😁
